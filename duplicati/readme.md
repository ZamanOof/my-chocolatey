**AFISCHER211'S PACKAGE NOTES (BASED ON BCURRAN3'S NOTES):**

* v2.x is still considered pre-release/"experimental" (beta) and in active development.
* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* I became a co-maintainer for this package from Bill (bcurran3) and try to refresh this package more frequently.
